The plan
=========

A configuration directory similar to /etc/cron.hourly, which should tipically be
/etc/webhooks.d/. Let's call it basedir

When a request for /hook/<name> is received, $basedir/$name is looked for.
Then it will run run-parts in that dir.

It will need a way to handle arguments to scripts from http query arguments.

Github support is the primary goal, even if broader compatibility/flexibility is
welcome.
